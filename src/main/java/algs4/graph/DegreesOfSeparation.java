 * Suppose the data structure looks like:
 * movie1: [performer, performer],
 * movie2: [performer, performer]
 * <br>
 * The process would be:
 * 1. To find the input performer's movies, using inverted index (performer -> movie)
 * 2. All the performers in the same movie with the input performer get number 1
 * 3. BFS adjacency vertices, with number increment
